**Rubber duck debugging** is a problem-solving technique where you explain your code or problem out loud to an inanimate object (traditionally a rubber duck) to help find bugs or solutions.

## How it works:

1. **Get a "duck"** - Any object works (rubber duck, pet, plant, or even an imaginary listener)
2. **Explain your code line-by-line** - Describe what each part is supposed to do
3. **Walk through the logic** - Explain your assumptions and reasoning
4. **Spot the problem** - Often, you'll catch the error mid-explanation

## Why it's effective:

### 🧠 **Forces different thinking**

- Speaking activates different brain areas than reading silently
- You process information more deliberately when explaining

### 🔍 **Reveals assumptions**

- Verbalizing makes hidden assumptions obvious
- You notice gaps in logic you glossed over mentally

### 🐌 **Slows you down**

- Explaining takes time, preventing you from skipping over details
- Forces you to examine each step methodically

## Example scenario:

text

```
You: "OK duck, this loop should sum all the numbers..."
You: "First, I initialize sum to 1... wait, that should be 0!"
*Problem solved*
```

## Pro tips:

- No duck? Explain to a colleague (or pretend to)
- Write out the explanation if talking feels awkward
- The key is articulating your thought process, not the duck itself

It sounds silly, but it's surprisingly effective and widely used by programmers at all levels!
