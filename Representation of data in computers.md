- Computers represent data in 0's and 1's thats in binary notation

**Binary** is the number system where there are only two values that is 0 and 1 and a sequence of those make up a piece of data.

for example, 

A number `202` in binary can be :

```binary
11001010
```

in the above piece you can see that there is no continuous streams of zeros as we see in decimal system.

But in binary that values start from 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 16 -> 32 -> 64 - > 128 -> 256 and so on.

you just plugin the values from *right to left as in the above sequence of 0's and 1's with the binary sequence* you will surely get the number 202

Proff just put in `2+8+64+128`
