**Computer Science** is the study of how computers work, how they process information, and how we can use them to solve problems. It’s not just about coding — it's about **logic, creativity, and problem-solving**.

Here’s a simple way to think about it:

- Imagine you're trying to solve a puzzle, but instead of pieces, you're working with **numbers, rules, and patterns**.
- You learn how to **build tools** (like apps or websites) that can help people in everyday life.
- You also learn how to **think like a computer** — breaking big problems into smaller, manageable parts.

If you enjoy solving puzzles, creating things, or understanding how things work — you might just fall in love with Computer Science! Would you like some beginner-friendly resources to get started?
