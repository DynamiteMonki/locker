# History behind Hello, World

Computer Scientist often print Hello World on the screen to signify the start of a learning journy.

---

So, let print hello world in C 

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	printf("Hello, World!\n");
	return 0;
}
```

- The `#include <stdio.h>` is a [[Header file]]
- The `int main(void){}` is a [[Function]] defination
- The `printf` function is from the `stdio.h` file 
- The `return 0;` is to end the program by giving out 0 as the [[Exit Code]]
